# KindLotus

Build: alpha testing

KindLotus is a web application built using Laravel and it runs at kindlotus.org. Its purpouse is to enable the persons who want to help the ones in need find nearby causes. Right now the front end is in romanian, but I will be translating it in english in the near future.
